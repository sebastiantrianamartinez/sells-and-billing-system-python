# SimpliSell: Empowering Sales and Billing with Python

The ongoing project is a basic sales system. Various functionalities have been implemented, including product management, sales execution, and invoice generation. The system allows for adding products, specifying their name, quantity, and price. Sales can be made by selecting the products and corresponding quantities. After each sale, an invoice is generated displaying the detailed information of the sold products and the total amount. Integration of alerts and confirmation messages has also been incorporated to provide user feedback. Python programming language has been utilized, along with different libraries and modules such as tkinter for the graphical interface and json for configuration management. The aim is to create a simple yet functional system that can be used for sales transactions and maintain a basic record of the transactions.
